# Â¡SpaceÂ·Rockets! app

I have created a favoriting system for a SpaceX frontend

I have uploaded the build to Netlify, which you can find here:

-   run `yarn` to install dependencies
-   run `yarn build` to build app for production
-   output is in `build` directory,
    [ready to be deployed](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)

## Data

All data is fetched from the unofficial SpaceX API V3 at
[spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest).

-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io) - Automated code formatter

## Code style and formatting

Prettier is used for code styling and ESLint is used to ensure code quality.

Both Prettier and ESLint are invoked on pre-commit with a hook on _staged files only_ (see the `lint-staged` section in the package.json file). Don't forget to enable `git hooks` on commit.

You can also manually invoke these tools with the following commands:

-   run `yarn prettify` to prettify the codebase
-   run `yarn lint:check` to check the code with ESLint
-   run `yarn lint:fix` to check the code and automatically try to fix any errors

See `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.json` files for the settings.

Running Prettier and ESLint on save actions is disabled by default. Enabling it depends on your IDE.

#### Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the ESLint and Prettier extensions.
2. Go to your preferences
3. Settings -> Select "User" tab -> Text Editor -> Formatting -> Select "Format On Save"

#### IntelliJ:

1. Install the Prettier plugin.
2. In the "ESLint" configuration enable "Automatic ESLint configuration" and "Run eslint --fix on save".
3. In the Prettier configuration panel enable "On Reformat Code action" and "On save"
